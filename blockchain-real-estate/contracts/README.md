# Blockchain Real Estate Smart Contracts

A decentralized real estate platform built on Ethereum, enabling property tokenization, management, and staking.

## 🏗 Architecture

### Core Contracts
- **PropertyToken**: ERC20Upgradeable token representing individual properties with fractional ownership
- **PropertyFactory**: Factory contract for deploying and managing PropertyTokens
- **Whitelist**: Access control for authorized addresses
- **StakingFactory**: Manages staking pools for property tokens
- **MockEURC**: Test stablecoin for transactions (EURC)

### Features
- Property tokenization (ERC20Upgradeable)
- Fractional property ownership
- Upgradeable proxy pattern
- Whitelist-based access control
- Property staking mechanism
- EURC stablecoin integration

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+
- Yarn v4.5+
- Hardhat
- Local Ethereum node (e.g., Hardhat Network)

### Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Compile contracts
yarn hardhat compile
```

### Environment Setup
Create `.env` file in the contracts directory:
```env
# Network Configuration
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_alchemy_key
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key

# Contract Addresses (auto-populated after deployment)
WHITELIST_PROXY_ADDRESS=
WHITELIST_IMPLEMENTATION_ADDRESS=
WHITELIST_ADMIN_ADDRESS=
PROPERTY_TOKEN_IMPLEMENTATION_ADDRESS=
PROPERTY_FACTORY_PROXY_ADDRESS=
PROPERTY_FACTORY_IMPLEMENTATION_ADDRESS=
PROPERTY_FACTORY_ADMIN_ADDRESS=
EURC_TOKEN_ADDRESS=
STAKING_FACTORY_ADDRESS=
```

Create `.env.local` in the root directory for frontend integration:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHITELIST_PROXY_ADDRESS=
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHITELIST_IMPLEMENTATION_ADDRESS=
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHITELIST_ADMIN_ADDRESS=
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROPERTY_TOKEN_IMPLEMENTATION_ADDRESS=
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROPERTY_FACTORY_PROXY_ADDRESS=
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROPERTY_FACTORY_IMPLEMENTATION_ADDRESS=
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROPERTY_FACTORY_ADMIN_ADDRESS=
NEXT_PUBLIC_EURC_TOKEN_ADDRESS=
NEXT_PUBLIC_STAKING_FACTORY_ADDRESS=
```

## 📜 Scripts

### Deployment
```bash
# Deploy all contracts
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy-proxy-optimized.ts --network localhost

# Show deployed addresses
yarn show-addresses
```

### Contract Management
```bash
# Whitelist an address
yarn whitelist --address <ethereum_address> --network localhost

# Distribute mock EURC
yarn hardhat run scripts/distribute-mock-eurc-optimized.ts --network localhost

# Fund staking factory
yarn fund:factory
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
yarn hardhat test

# Run specific test suites
yarn test:pt  # PropertyToken tests
yarn test:pf  # PropertyFactory tests
```

## 🔒 Security

### Proxy Pattern
- Transparent proxy pattern for upgradeability
- Admin controls for proxy management
- Implementation contracts are immutable

### Access Control
- Whitelist-based authorization
- Role-based access control for admin functions
- Timelock for critical operations

### Best Practices
- OpenZeppelin contracts for standard implementations
- Comprehensive test coverage
- External audit recommended before mainnet deployment

## 🛠 Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**
   ```bash
   # Start local node
   yarn hardhat node
   
   # Deploy contracts
   yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy-proxy-optimized.ts --network localhost
   
   # Verify deployment
   yarn show-addresses
   ```

2. **Testing Changes**
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   yarn hardhat test
   
   # Check test coverage
   yarn hardhat coverage
   ```

3. **Upgrading Contracts**
   - Deploy new implementation
   - Update proxy to point to new implementation
   - Verify state preservation

## 📝 Contract Addresses Management

The system maintains contract addresses in two locations:
1. `/contracts/.env`: For hardhat and contract interactions
2. `/.env.local`: For frontend integration (with NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix)

The deploy script automatically syncs both files.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Always run scripts with the correct network flag
- Keep private keys secure and never commit them
- Verify contract addresses after deployment
- Test thoroughly before mainnet deployment
- Monitor gas costs for optimizations
